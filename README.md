# DMRTA2
Analysis of DMRTA2+ glioma cells in human GBM for MM. (scRNA)

The hypothesis: DMRTA2+ glioma cells are similar to percityes thus they promote angiogenesis.


Dataset:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17186-5#Tab1
The steam cells matrixes were discarded. Only matrixes of GBM cells from patients were used for analysis and these matrixes 
are located on a new server (belonging to sequencing facility), port:2219 location:/home/rstudio/all/DMRTA2/neurodevelopment/filtered/BTonly/.

Important info! Several patients data was divided into two matrixes and was marged together later in R, befor creation of SeuratObject.
